## Description
As an artist, I love any time I am able to combine my passions. When the opportunity presented itself to photograph musical insturments, I jumped at it. Of course, this meant that I needed a website to showcase my work. I decided to build the website in React. This uses a masonry gallery that has an associated lightbox from React Photo Album and Yet Another React Lightbox.
